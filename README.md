Project Scope Statement
The Covid-19 Tracker is designed to provide students, faculty, and staff about the number of confirmed cases, students in isolation/quarantine, and recoveries.  The tracker will provide individuals with the neccessary resources such as location of testing and vaccination sites and the procedures to take if they've been exposed to someone with Covid-19 or have tested positive for it.
